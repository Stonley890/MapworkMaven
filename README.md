# MapworkMaven

Create custom Minecraft worlds at massive scale.

---

MapworkMaven is a program that allows you to create Minecraft worlds using brushes and tools like a drawing or sculpting program. It is written in Rust and is inspired by the legendary [WorldPainter](https://www.worldpainter.net).

My personal motiviations for this project are:

- Learning Rust
- Learning desktop GUI development
- Improving Minecraft world creation tools
